# File Extensions

All code files are just text! Different file extensions (`.md`, `.html`, `.css`,
...) exist to tell people and computers what language the file contains.

In this folder are some files without an extension, your task is to read the
text in each file and
[rename them](https://vscode-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor/codebasics/#explorer)
with the correct file extension. All of the files will use one of these
extensions. (All of these languages are covered in the HYF curriculum):

- `.css` -
  [Cascading Style Sheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS):
  - the language used to add styling and layout to your web pages.
- `.html` -
  [HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML):
  - the language used to define the _structure_ of your web pages
- `.js` - [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript):
  - the main language of web development, you will use JS to write your
    _frontends_ and your _backends_
- `.json` -
  [JavaScript Object Notation](https://attacomsian.com/blog/what-is-json):
  - a common format for data sent across the internet, for configuration files
    and for _persisting_ simple application data.
- `.jsonc` - [JSON with Comments](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55708553):
  - JSON, but with comments. this is used configuration files.
- `.md` - [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown):
  - this will be _everywhere_. in issues, in READMEs, in documentation, in pull
    requests, ... everywhere.
- `.sh` -
  [Bash](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php):
  - you'll use bash commands from your Command Line Interface to do things like
    navigate your file system, install project dependencies, and much more. You
    won't often need to write files of Bash but it is possible.
- `.txt` or no extension -
  [Plain Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text):
  - you'll see this mostly just for LICENSE files and some configurations.
- `.yml` - [YAML Ain't Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML):
  - like .json, a format for storing data and configurations, you will see this
    in the `.github/workflows` folder of HYF repositories.

> You don't need to understand the text to identify which language it is!
