# Markdown

The biggest part of programming isn't coding, it's communicating. Every software
project comes with documentation that helps you understand how it works, and you
will learn how to write these documents yourself! Markdown is commonly used in
Open Source Software projects for everything except the code itself.

Fortunately, markdown is also pretty simple. You won't be writing your
applications in Markdown but you will be using all the time to:

- Plan your projects as a group
- Review each other's code
- Document your code
- Keep track of your class work
- Maybe to keep your notes!

## Learning Markdown

Well, there isn't really that much to study. You can learn everything you need
to learn just by writing a few good READMEs. These resources should be enough to
get you going

- Example markdown files in the [./examples](./examples) folder
- [Markdown CheatSheet PDF](./cheatsheet.pdf) (downloaded from
