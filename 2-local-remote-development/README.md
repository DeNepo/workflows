# Local/Remote Development

## Licenses

### Why Licenses Matter

Including a license for your code on GitHub is crucial for clarifying how others can use, modify, and distribute your work.
 It provides a legal framework for your project.

### Choosing the Right License

Select a license that aligns with how you want others to use your code. GitHub offers various licenses, each with its
 own terms and conditions.

## GitHub SSH Key

### Connecting with SSH

Enhance the security of your GitHub interactions by connecting your computer to your GitHub account using an SSH key.
 This enables secure cloning, pushing, and pulling using your SSH connection.

## GitHub Repositories

### Creating and Configuring Repositories

- **Creating a New Repository:**
  Initialize a new repository on GitHub with ease.

- **Writing Repository Descriptions:**
  Craft meaningful descriptions for your repositories to convey their purpose and functionality.

- **GitHub Pages:**
  Turn on GitHub Pages to host a website directly from your repository.

- **Main Branch Protection:**
  Configure your repository to block pushing to the main branch and merging until Continuous Integration (CI) checks pass.

## Git Remote/Local Connection

### Mastering Git Commands

- **Cloning Repositories:**
  Use `git clone <remote-url>` to clone a remote repository to your local machine.

- **Initializing and Connecting Repositories:**
  Set up a new local repository and link it to an empty remote repository.

- **Pushing and Pulling:**
  Utilize `git push` to upload local content to a remote repository. Understand the difference between `git fetch` and
   `git pull`.

- **Branch Operations:**
  Manage changes by pushing and pulling between remote and local branches. Distinguish between `git fetch` and `git pull`.

## Pull Requests

### Collaborative Code Integration

- **Creating Pull Requests:**
  Generate pull requests between branches for seamless integration.

- **Pull Request Templates:**
  Implement PR templates with checklists to ensure code quality before merging to the main branch.

## Continuous Integration

### Maintaining Code Quality

- **GitHub Actions:**
  Leverage GitHub Actions to run CI checks before merging a pull request to the main branch.

## Local/Remote Branching Workflow

### Best Practices for Collaboration

1. **Check Out a New Local Branch:**
   Create a new local branch for your contribution.

2. **Synchronize with Main:**
   Keep your local main in sync with remote main by pulling changes.

3. **Merge Workflow:**
   Merge changes from local main to your new branch, resolving conflicts if necessary.

4. **Code Formatting and Linting:**
   Ensure code quality by formatting and linting your changes.

5. **Push to Remote:**
   Push your local branch to the remote repository.

6. **Open Pull Request:**
   Initiate a pull request from your branch to the main branch.

7. **PR Checklist:**
   Complete the PR checklist to verify the correctness of your changes.

8. **CI Checks:**
   Confirm that all CI checks pass successfully.

9. **Merge to Main:**
   Merge your remote branch into the main branch.

10. **Branch Cleanup:**
    Optionally, delete the branch after successful merging.
