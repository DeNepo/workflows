## Learning Objectives

<details>
<summary>Priorities: 🥚, 🐣, 🐥, 🐔 (click to learn more)</summary>
<br>

There is a lot to learn in this repository. If you can't master all the material
at once, that's expected! Anything you don't master now will always be waiting
for you to review when you need it. These 4 emoji's will help you prioritize
your study time and to measure your progress:

- 🥚: Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll
  need for this module and the next. You do not need to finish all of them but
  should feel comfortable that you could with enough time.
- 🐣: You have started all of these exercises and feel you could complete them
  all if you just had more time. It may not be easy for you but with effort you
  can make it through.
- 🐥: You have studied the examples and started some exercises if you had time.
  You should have a big-picture understanding of these concepts/skills, but may
  not be confident completing the exercises.
- 🐔: These concepts or skills are not necessary but are related to this module.
  If you are finished with 🥚, 🐣 and 🐥 you can use the 🐔 exercises to push
  yourself without getting distracted from the module's main objectives.

### 🥚 [0. Local Development Without Git](./0-local-development-without-git)

Practice the foundational workflows of software development by learning to write
Markdown locally on your own computer using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), the
Command Line Interface (CLI), and NPM scripts to automate your code's quality
(formatting, linting and spell checking).

- [ ] 🥚 **Folder Structures**: You can explain how files and folders are stored
      in your computer and can find, open or create files in your computer
      without using the Command Line Interface.
- 🥚 **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: In a Unix shell you can ...
  - [ ] Open a new terminal window
  - [ ] Navigate up and down directories using `cd`
  - [ ] List the contents of a directory using `ls`
  - [ ] View the contents of a file using `cat`
  - [ ] Create new files using `touch`
  - [ ] Create new folders using `mkdir`
- [ ] 🥚 **Markdown**: You can write a document in Markdown with no syntax
      mistakes that renders into a well-formatted document.
- 🥚 **VSCode**: You can complete these workflows in VScode, and can use
  keyboard shortcuts to complete them all:
  - [ ] Opening a repository in a new window
  - [ ] Opening the VSCode terminal
  - [ ] Adding a new file
  - [ ] Adding a new folder
  - [ ] Deleting a file
  - [ ] Deleting a folder
  - [ ] Previewing a Markdown File
  - [ ] Formatting a Markdown document
- [ ] 🥚 **READMEs**: You can write a README file that describes the project you
      are working on, why it's helpful, and how someone can use it.
- 🥚 **NPM**: You can use NPM commands to verify your code's quality, this
  includes ...
  - [ ] Using `npm install` to install a project's dependencies
  - [ ] Reading a `package.json` file to find which scripts are available for
        the project
  - [ ] Use `npm run <script>` to execute an npm script
- 🥚 **Formatting Code**: You can use Prettier to make sure all the code in your
  project is well-formatted:
  - [ ] You can use the Prettier VSCode extension to format a document while you
        are writing it
  - [ ] You can use `npm run format` to format all of the documents in your
        project
  - [ ] You can use `npm run format:check` to make sure all files are
        well-formatted
- 🥚 **Linting Folder and File Names**: You can ...
  - [ ] Use `npm run lint:ls` to check all folder and file names in your project
  - [ ] You can fix all linting mistakes reported by `npm run lint:ls`
- 🥚 **Linting Code**: You can ...
  - [ ] Use `npm run lint:md` to check all Markdown files in your folder for
        linting mistakes
  - [ ] You can fix all linting mistakes reported by `npm run lint:md`
- 🥚 **Spell Check**: You can ...
  - [ ] Use the Code Spell Checker VSCode extension to correct spelling mistakes
        in your Markdown documents while you are writing
  - [ ] Use `npm run spell-check` to check the spelling in all the files of your
        project
  - [ ] Update `.cspell.json` to add words that should be allowed in your
        project
- 🥚 **File and Folder Naming Conventions**: You can ...
  - [ ] Identify and follow the naming conventions for the project you are
        working on.
  - [ ] Use `npm run lint:ls` to check that all files and folders follow the
        project's naming conventions.
  - [ ] You can correct any file and folder names to make them match the project
        conventions.
- [ ] 🐣 **File Extensions**: You can identify all of the languages covered at
      HYF and give the correct file extension. You don't need to know the
      languages, just recognize them.
- [ ] 🐣 **Touch Typing**: You can write a Markdown file without looking at your
      keyboard to find any letters, numbers or special characters. (slowly is
      ok!)

### 🥚 [1. Local Development With Git](./1-local-development-with-git)

Practice using Git to save and organize your development process. You will learn
how you can use Git to go back to previous versions of your project, and to work
on different changes in parallel.

- 🥚 **Git**: Using the CLI you can ...
  - [ ] Initialize a new git repository with `git init`
  - [ ] Stage changes using `git add <path>`
  - [ ] Check what is staged with `git status`
  - [ ] Commit changes using `git commit -m <message>`
  - [ ] Display your repository's git history using `git log`
  - [ ] Create a new branch using `git branch <branch-name>`
  - [ ] Check out a branch using `git checkout <branch-name>`
  - [ ] Create a new branch and check it out using
        `git checkout -b <branch-name>`

## Study Tips

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

- Don't rush, understand! Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to fail tests slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass
    tests quickly and not understand why.
- Don't skip the examples! Understanding and experimenting with working code is
  a very effective way to learn programming.
- Write lots of comments in the examples and exercises. The code in this
  repository is yours to study, modify and re-use in projects.
- Practice

## Code Quality Scripts

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

This repository comes with some scripts to check the quality of this code. You
can run these scripts to check the code provided by HYF, and to check the code
you write when experiment with the examples and complete the exercises.

### `npm run format`

This script will format all of the code in this repository making sure that all
the indentations are correct, the code is easy to read, and letting you know if
there are any syntax errors.

### `npm run format:check`

Checks the formatting of all files in the repository and throws an error if any
files are not well-formatted.

### `npm run spell-check`

This script will check all of the files in your repository for spelling
mistakes. Spelling is not just a detail, is important! Good spelling helps
others read and understand your programs with less effort.

`spell-check` is not so clever though, it doesn't have _all_ possible words in
it's dictionary and it won't know if you _wanted_ to spell a word incorrectly.
If you think one of it's "Unknown word"s is not a problem, you can either ignore
the suggestion or add the word to the `"words": [ ... ],` list in
[.cspell.json](./.cspell.json).

### `npm run lint:md`

This script will [lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) all
the Markdown files in this repository, checking for syntax mistakes and other
bad practices. Fixing linting errors will help you learn to write better code by
pointing out your mistakes _before_ they cause problems in your program.

Some linting errors will take some practice to understand and fix, but it will
be a good use of time.

### `npm run lint:ls`

This script will [lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) the
names of all files and folders in the project to check that they follow the
project naming convention
([kebab-case](https://betterprogramming.pub/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841)).
