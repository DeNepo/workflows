# Deliverables

This module has 3 deliverables. One is a contribution to the class repository,
one is a group project to practice collaboration and the other is a group
project to practice following a development strategy.

_Writing code is still writing!_

Take the time to proof read and edit your code before sharing it. Your
colleagues and your future self will thank you. Practice using the NPM scripts
in the starter repository and the VSC plugins you installed with the Precourse
to write correct markdown:

- Format your code with Prettier
- Fix any spelling mistakes
- Fix any linting errors
- Preview the rendered Markdown or HTML/CSS, does it look like you wanted?
