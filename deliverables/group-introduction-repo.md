# Group Introduction

> use this starter repository:
> [Markdown template repository](https://github.com/DeNepo/template-markdown)

Find a time to meet with your study group and build a get-to-know-you repository
with one markdown file per person in your group. This doesn't need to be
anything fancy. Your focus should be on getting to know each other and learning
to work on a shared repository.

When you're ready to start your group repo, create a new issue in the class repo
using the `deliverable` template and add the `group` label. Fill out the
project's description, list your group members, and paste this checklist into
your issue before
[adding it to the Class Projects board](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board):

> PS. check out other HYF classes for inspiration
