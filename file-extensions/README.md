# File Extensions

All code files are just text! Different file extensions (`.md`, `.html`, `.css`,
...) exist to tell people and computers what language the file contains.

In this folder are some files without an extension, your task is to read the
text in each file and
[rename them](https://vscode-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor/codebasics/#explorer)
with the correct file extension. All of the files will use one of these
extensions. (All of these languages are covered in the HYF curriculum):

- `.txt` - [Plain Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text)
- `.md` - [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- `.sh` -
  [Bash](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php)
- `.html` -
  [HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- `.css` -
  [Cascading Style Sheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- `.js` - [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
- `.json` -
  [JavaScript Object Notation](https://attacomsian.com/blog/what-is-json)
- `.sql` -
  [Structured Query Language](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-overview.htm)

> You don't need to understand the text to identify which language it is!
