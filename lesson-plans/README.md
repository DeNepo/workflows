# Lesson Plans

In this module you will focus on the fundamental workflows you need as a
developer working alone and in a group. This includes using VSCode, the command line,
formatting & linting code, using Git and GitHub.

You will practice these skills using the
[`template-markdown`](https://github.com/DeNepo/template-markdown) repository.

## Before the class

- Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer
- Practice navigating directories using the Command Line Interface
- Play around a little with
  [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- Take a look through
  [First Day on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-day-on-github)
- Begin watching
  [Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)

### Before Break

> All Together

- __10 min__: Q/A and review of previous materials
- __40 minutes__: A coach shares their screen and does a guided walk through the
  [`template-markdown`](https://github.com/DeNepo/template-markdown) repository:
  - what is git? and github?
  - how to clone a repository from github?
  - what is NPM?
  - how do you install NPM dependencies?
  - how can you find NPM scripts in a `package.json` file?
  - what is linting? and formatting?
- __60 min__: in small groups, practice writing great Markdown using code quality
  checks, each person should try on their own computer:

    repository
  - Open it in VSCode
  - Install dependencies
  - Write some Markdown in the README and practice adding new files
  - Practice using the formatting, linting and spell-check scripts to improve
    your Markdown
- __10 min__: All together, each group quickly presents:
  - what went well
  - what went less well
  - lessons learned

### After Break

> all together

- __20 min__: Introduction to collaborative development
- __20 min__: Form small random groups and split up:
  - Read through the Group Introduction deliverable and make sure everyone
    understand the project
  - Generate a repository for each group in the class organization using the
    [`template-markdown`](https://github.com/DeNepo/template-markdown)
    repository

- __40 min__: In small groups, prepare for the week's deliverable:
  - Set up your group's repository:
    - The Basics
      - Use the name your team decided on

        repository's About section
      - Turn on Discussions in your repository
    - Collaboration Settings
      - Add everyone in your team as a contributor with _Admin_ access
      - Require a code review for PRs to `main`
        ([owanateamachree](https://owanateamachree.medium.com/how-to-protect-the-master-branch-on-github-ab85e9b6b03),
        [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews))
        - You will need to type `main` or `master` into the _Branch name
          pattern_ input box (depending on which on what your repo's default
          branch is named)
        - Select _Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are
          pushed_
  - Create your group's deliverable issue and place it on the class project
    board
  - Set up your group repo's project board
  - Make sure everyone is ready for the week
- __10 min__: Come back together for a short check-in from each group and Q/A with
  the coaches
