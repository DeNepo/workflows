# VSCode and Git

In this workshop you will focus on the fundamental workflows you need as a
developer working alone. This includes using VSCode, the command line,
formatting & linting code, and using Git.

You will practice these skills using the
[`template-markdown`](https://github.com/DeNepo/template-markdown) repository.

## Before

- Practice navigating directories using the Command Line Interface

  [`template-markdown`](https://github.com/DeNepo/template-markdown) repository:
  - what is git? and github?
  - how to clone a repository from github?
  - what is NPM?
  - how do you install NPM dependencies?
  - how can you find NPM scripts in a `package.json` file?
  - what is linting? and formatting?

### After Break

- _60 min_: in small groups, practice writing great Markdown using code quality
  checks, each person should try on their own computer:

    repository
  - Open it in VSCode
  - Install dependencies
  - Write some Markdown in the README and practice adding new files

- _15 min_: All together, each group quickly presents:
  - what went well
  - what went less well
  - lessons learned
- _15 min_: introduce the week's deliverable

## After

- Read over the learning objectives for chapters 0, 1 & 2
- Work your way through the exercises for these chapters (if there are any in
  the folders)
- Study the [Suggested Study](../suggested-study.md) for these chapters
- Complete the [Student Bio PR](../deliverables/student-bio-pr.md) deliverable
