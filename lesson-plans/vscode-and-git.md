# VSCode and Git

In this workshop you will focus on the fundamental workflows you need as a
developer working alone. This includes using VSCode, the command line,
formatting & linting code, and using Git.

You will practice these skills using the
[`template-markdown`](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-markdown)
repository.

## Before

- Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer
- Practice navigating directories using the Command Line Interface
- Play around a little with
  [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

  [First Day on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-day-on-github)
- Begin watching
  [Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)

### Before Break

> All Together

- _15 min_: Introductions from each coach & Q/A time about the secret lives of
  developers
- _30 min_: Q/A and review of previous materials
- _75 minutes_: A coach shares their screen and does a guided walk through the
  [`template-markdown`](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-markdown)
  repository:
  - what is git? and github?
  - how to clone a repository from github?
  - what is NPM?
  - how do you install NPM dependencies?
  - how can you find NPM scripts in a `package.json` file?
  - what is linting? and formatting?

### After Break

- _60 min_: in small groups, practice writing great Markdown using code quality
  checks, each person should try on their own computer:
  - Clone the
    [`template-markdown`](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-markdown)
    repository
  - Open it in VSCode
  - Install dependencies
  - Write some Markdown in the README and practice adding new files
  - Practice using the formatting, linting and spell-check scripts to improve
    your Markdown
- _15 min_: All together, each group quickly presents:
  - what went well
  - what went less well
  - lessons learned
- _15 min_: introduce the week's deliverable

## After

- Read over the learning objectives for chapters 0, 1 & 2
- Work your way through the exercises for these chapters (if there are any in
  the folders)
- Study the [Suggested Study](../suggested-study.md) for these chapters
- Complete the [Student Bio PR](../deliverables/student-bio-pr.md) deliverable
