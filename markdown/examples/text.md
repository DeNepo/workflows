# writing text

When writing long blocks of text you can use a new line without creating a new
line in the output.

Unless you do _two_ newlines!

This makes it possible to write markdown that fits nicely in a narrow editor,
but still renders to fill the screen.

In the middle of a paragraph you can drop little bits of code, for example:
`console.log('hi!')`.
