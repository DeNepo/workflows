# Project Starter

Starter materials for the Planning and Collaborating deliverable, you can
copy-paste these files into your repository's `/planning` folder:

- **[./user-personas.md](./user-personas.md)**: A description of your website's
  users and their motivations.
- **[./backlog.md](./backlog.md)**: The prioritized list of user stories in your
  project.
- **[./design.md](./design.md)** & **[./wireframe.svg](./wireframe.svg)**: A
  wireframe and some explanation of the site's design.
- **[./development-strategy.md](./development-strategy.md)**: A high-level plan
  for the steps you will use while building the site, and what code you might
  need for each step. This is a living document! You don't need to make a
  perfect plan from the beginning, and your team should adjust the strategy
  during development if something isn't working.

This file will help you figure out how to convert your `development-strategy.md`
into issues, labels and milestones:

- **[./issues.md](./issues.md)**: A suggestion for issues you can put on your
  project board.

And these files contain the finished code & assets your group will be
reconstructing one Pull Request at a time. You _should not_ copy-paste these
files directly into the repository. Instead each group member will contribute a
small part of the code one PR at a time until the entire site has been
reassembled on the `main` branch:

- **[./index.html](./index.html)**
- **[./styles.css](./styles.css)**
- **[./happy-tree.jpg](./happy-tree.jpg)**

You don't like something about the web page? No problem! You're encouraged to
make any changes to the plan or code as long as your whole team agrees.
