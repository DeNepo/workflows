# Project Starter

Starter materials for the Development Strategy deliverable:

- **[./backlog.md](./backlog.md)**: The prioritized list of user stories in your
  project.
- **[./design.md](./design.md)**: A wireframe and some explanation of the site's
  design.
- **[./development-strategy.md](./development-strategy.md)**: A high-level plan
  for the steps you will use while building the site, and what code you might
  need for each step. This is a living document! You don't need to make a
  perfect plan from the beginning, and your team should adjust the strategy
  during development if something isn't working.
- **[./issues.md](./issues.md)**: A suggestion for issues you can put on your
  project board.

You don't like something about the web page? No problem! You're encouraged to
make any changes to the plan or code as long as your whole team agrees.
